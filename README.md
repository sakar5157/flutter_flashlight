# Flutter Flashlight App

A simple Flutter app that utilizes the device's camera to turn it into a flashlight. The app features a toggle button to switch the flashlight on and off, and it dynamically adjusts the system UI overlay style based on the flashlight state, providing a dark mode experience when the flashlight is off.

## Features

- Toggle the flashlight on and off with a button.
- Dark mode is enabled when the flashlight is off, and it switches to light mode when the flashlight is on.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots or gifs of your app in action.
